# Bert NLP text classification project
Building a forum classifier for Discourse forum posts with BERT

* Webscrape data from 7 public Discourse forums to get texts from posts and their associated metadata.
* Use a transformer-based neural architecture (BERT) as a feature extractor to create a sequence level embedding for each post that holds information to how each sequence is relative to each other.
* Build a forum classifier to predict the forum for any given post.
